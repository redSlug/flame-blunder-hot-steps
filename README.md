# ðŸ”¥ Flame Blunder: Hot Steps ðŸ”¥

A Pico-8 game where your uncontrollable fire breath keeps causing problems in unexpected ways!

## Game Concept

You play as a cursed adventurer who breathes fire every time you jump, land too hard, or get startled. The game challenges you to navigate puzzle-like platforming levels without setting too much of your environment on fire!

## How to Run the Game

3. **Run the Game**: After loading the code, simply type `run` to start playing!

## Game Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Move left/right

- **X/V**: Hold breath (temporarily stops fire but slows movement)

## Game Features

- **Fire Mechanics**: Your character breathes fire when jumping, landing hard, or getting startled
- **Fire Spread**: Watch as fire spreads across flammable objects
- **Enemy Reactions**: Enemies react differently to fire - some get scared, some get angry
- **Water Areas**: Cool off in water puddles to temporarily suppress your fire breath
- **Explosives**: Use fire to trigger explosions that can open new paths
- **Win Condition**: Reach the goal in each level to progress

## Gameplay Tips

- Fire can both help and hinder you - use it strategically!
- Wooden platforms (brown tiles) are flammable - they'll burn away if you set them on fire
- Stone and metal surfaces (gray/blue tiles) are safe from fire
- Holding your breath (X/V) prevents you from breathing fire, but depletes your breath meter
- Fire can spread from one flammable object to another - be careful!
- Explosives can help destroy obstacles but can also hurt you if you're too close
